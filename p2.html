            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This project was a final project designed for my Information Design course. 
                Students had a choice to work individually or in a group (2-4 people), to 
                design and code a website.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="div3">
            <h2>Details</h2>
            <p>Type: Team Project</p>
            <p>Group Members: Cayli Barrett, Louis Fourie, George Lin, Melissa Ly</p>
            <p>Programs Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator</p>
            <p>Requirements: topic of the website has to be environmentally related, a flexible 
                website (either fluid, adaptive or responsive), consists of images and data 
                (tables, graphs, etc.), contain the appropriate information</p>

            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Our website acted as an organization that informed users of Killer Whales. 
                It provided information about how they were being harmed, how to help them, 
                where to go for more information, about us, and how to contact us.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="div7">
            <h2>Difficulties & Resolutions</h2>
            <p>A difficulty the group came across was coding together. Since we none of us 
                coded in groups before nor knew about GitHub, we were stumped on how to code 
                as a group. We decided to sync a group folder on Google Drive, so that every 
                time we edited a file for the project, it would automatically sync up to the 
                rest of the project.</p>

            <h2>Evaluation</h2>
            <p>The results of the overall project were excellent on some parts and needed 
                improvements on others, but it met all the requirements of the project. An 
                improvement to my part in the website would be the mobile version of the 
                website. The mobile version could have less padding inorder to make it so the 
                information doesn’t look crowded. I learnt how to code as a group, although 
                it wasn’t the best method. I also learnt that there are sites like GitHub that 
                llow groups of coders to code together.</p>
