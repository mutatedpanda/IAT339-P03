                <p>This project was a final project designed for my Information Design course. 
                    Students had a choice to work individually or in a group (2-4 people), to 
                    design and code a website.</p>

                <h2>Process</h2>
                <p>The first step my group took was to make the site map of the website.
                    I put together a simple site map, so that my group understood what
                    each page needed.

        <div class="div5">
            <div class="words">
                <p> Next, as a group, we put together some wireframes of the website.</p>

        <div class="div7">
            <div class="words">
                <p>We assigned pages to each member in the group and individually 
                    worked on them. I was assigned the contact page.

                <h2>Difficulties & Resolutions</h2>
                <p>A difficulty the group came across was coding together. Since we none of us 
                    coded in groups before nor knew about GitHub, we were stumped on how to code 
                    as a group. We decided to sync a group folder on Google Drive, so that every 
                    time we edited a file for the project, it would automatically sync up to the 
                    rest of the project.</p>

                <h2>Evaluation</h2>
                <p>The results of the overall project were excellent on some parts and needed 
                    improvements on others, but it met all the requirements of the project. An 
                    improvement to my part in the website would be the mobile version of the 
                    website. The mobile version could have less padding inorder to make it so the 
                    information doesn’t look crowded. I learnt how to code as a group, although 
                    it wasn’t the best method. I also learnt that there are sites like GitHub that 
                    llow groups of coders to code together.</p>
