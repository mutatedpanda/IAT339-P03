                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Type: Individual Project</p>
                <p>Programs Used: Android Studio, Adobe Illustrator</p>
                <p>This project was the final project for my Mobile Computing course (IAT 359). 
                    Students got the freedom to create any application on the phone that met a 
                    set of requirements.</p>

                <h2>Process</h2>
                <p>The first step was making a proposal of the application that you wanted to
                    make. The proposal include information about what type of application you
                    were making, how it met the requirements, the structure of the
                    application, and a schedule you will follow.</p>

        <div class="div5">
            <div class="words">
                <p>Next was to research methods of programming a game in Android 
                    Studio without using a third-party program.</p>

        <div class="div7">
            <div class="words">
                <p>I then started to code the application, making sure to code the 
                    initial requirements first.</p>

            <div class="words">
                <p>The final product was a gaming application called Fallen. 
                    The players play as a character that is falling and has to dodge 
                    obstacles along the way down. It is an endless game, so players 
                    can compete with their friends to see who could get a higher 
                    score.</p>

                <h2>Difficulties & Resolutions</h2>
                <p>The difficulties I encountered while coding the game were coding game 
                    functionalities in Android Studio without using a third-party program. To 
                    resolve this, it required a lot of researching, which resulted in finding a 
                    method to do so.</p>

                <h2>Evaluation</h2>
                <p>The results of the project was successful and met all the requirements. An 
                    improvement that can be made to this would be fixing the bug with the 
                    interaction with the playerâ€™s character and the obstacles. What I learnt 
                    from this project was actually making a game in Android Studio. I also learnt that it 
                    was possible to make a game in Android Studio without using and third-party 
                    program, after being advised that it may not be possible to do so.</p>
