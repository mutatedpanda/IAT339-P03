            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This project was the final project for my Mobile Computing course (IAT 359). 
                Students got the freedom to create any application on the phone that met a 
                set of requirements.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="div3">
            <h2>Details</h2>
            <p>Type: Individual Project</p>
            <p>Programs Used: Android Studio, Adobe Illustrator</p>
            <p>Requirements: have at least three activities, explicit and implicit intents, 
                data storage in local SQLite Database and Shared Preferences (the ability to 
                add/remove data and perform queries in the database), and device hardware 
                usage (sensors and GPS or camera functionality</p>

            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>The application that I chose to make was a gaming application called Fallen. 
                This game was inspired by DoodleJump. The players would play as a character 
                that was falling and would have to dodge obstacles along the way down. It was 
                an endless game, so players can compete with their friends to see who could 
                get a higher score.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="div7">
            <h2>Difficulties & Resolutions</h2>
            <p>The difficulties I encountered while coding the game were coding game 
                functionalities in Android Studio without using a third-party program. To 
                resolve this, it required a lot of researching, which resulted in finding a 
                method to do so.</p>

        <div class="div10">
            <h2>Evaluation</h2>
            <p>The results of the project was successful and met all the requirements. An 
                improvement that can be made to this would be fixing the bug with the 
                interaction with the playerâ€™s character and the obstacles. What I learnt 
                from this project was actually making a game in Android Studio since the 
                course did not specifically teach us how to do this. I also learnt that it 
                was possible to make a game in Android Studio without using and third-party 
                program, after being advised that it may not be possible to do so.</p>
